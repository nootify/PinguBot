# PinguBot
A simple Discord bot running on the discord.py library

## Requirements
To run the both, Python 3 and a copy of this repo is required.

To run the included installation script, a Linux distro that has Bash is required.

## Installation
To automatically install and set everything, run the included setup.sh script.

To install the dependencies manually, run the following:
```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To create the environment needed to run the bot manually, create a `.env` file.
Then paste the following inside: `PINGU_TOKEN=<Your token goes here>`
Make sure to replace `<Your token goes here>` with your bot token from the Discord Developer Portal.
Do not add spaces in between the `=` or else your bot will not function.
